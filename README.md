If you are interested in learning programming with having no prior experience, the book is for you. `Programming essentials`
has a distinct way of teaching. The book introduces the general programming concepts in case studies. These concepts are
the same in most programming languages. It shows why you need the concepts, and it shows the implementation in the `Go`
language. This method is called `absract teaching`.

In addition to other programming books, you will learn the following:
- Stages of learning with `Shu Ha Ri`
- How applications are executed in Linux
- Basic Linux commands
- Developing code via terminal without any complex tool
- Accessing course materials and settings via Docker to have consistency across environments for users
